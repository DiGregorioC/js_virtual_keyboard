# js_virtual_keyboard

Created a virtual keyboard app in Javascript.

**What I got gained from this:**
- Continued practice with javascript and DOM manipulation and traversal 
- Continued practice with CSS classes, and selectors
- Experience working with material design icons


**Future:**
- Implement this into another larger application
- Implement this into a phone app
